<h3>Rosewood</h3>

<p>The tree has grey bark that peels in long fibres, pinnately compound leaves, and bunches of small white flowers.[2] It grows as both an evergreen and a deciduous tree in the deciduous monsoon forests of India making the tree very drought hardy.</p>

<p>Haematonectria haematococca is a fungal pest of the tree, causing damage to the leaves and the heartwood in Javanese plantations.[4] In India, trees may be subject to serious damage from a species of Phytophthora, a water mold genus.[4]</p>
