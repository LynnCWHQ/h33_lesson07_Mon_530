    <h3>Pine Tree</h3>
    
    <p>Pines are softwoods, but commercially they may be designated as soft pines or hard pines. Soft pines, such as white, sugar, and pi√±on pines, have relatively soft timber, needles in bundles of five (less commonly, one to four), stalked cones with scales lacking prickles, and little resin. Their wood is close-grained, with thin, nearly white sapwood; the sheaths of the leaf clusters are deciduous, and the leaves contain a single fibrovascular bundle. </p>
    
    <p>Pine trees (genus Pinus) are evergreen, conifers (they produce cones that encase reproduction seeds) and can be found throughout the world, but they are native to northern temperate regions. </p>
